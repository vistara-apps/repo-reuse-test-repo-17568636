# Technical Specifications

## Overview
This document outlines the technical specifications for the repo-reuse-test application, a Base blockchain-integrated web application.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.3.3, React 18
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.1
- **Blockchain Integration**: 
  - OnchainKit for wallet connection
  - Wagmi for blockchain interactions
  - Viem for chain configurations
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query)
- **Data Storage**: Upstash Redis for caching and temporary data storage
- **Authentication**: Wallet-based authentication using Coinbase OnchainKit

## Architecture
The application follows a client-side rendered architecture with Next.js App Router, with the following key components:

### Core Components
1. **Wallet Connection**: Implemented using OnchainKit's ConnectWallet component
2. **API Layer**: RESTful API endpoints for data retrieval and submission
3. **Blockchain Interaction**: Direct interaction with Base blockchain using Wagmi hooks
4. **Data Persistence**: Combination of local storage and Upstash Redis for data caching

### Directory Structure

```

## Performance Considerations
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading for optimal bundle size
- Use React Query for efficient data fetching and caching
- Implement proper memoization for expensive computations
- Optimize blockchain interactions to minimize network requests

## Security Measures
- Implement proper input validation for all user inputs
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Follow best practices for wallet connection security
- Regular security audits for smart contract interactions

## Deployment
- CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
- Deployment to Vercel for frontend hosting
- Environment-specific configurations for development, staging, and production

## Monitoring and Analytics
- Implement error tracking using an appropriate service
- Add analytics for user behavior tracking
- Monitor blockchain interaction success rates
- Track performance metrics for continuous improvement

## Browser Compatibility
- Support for modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile-responsive design for all screen sizes
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers

## Accessibility
- Implement WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Ensure proper keyboard navigation
- Provide appropriate ARIA attributes
- Test with screen readers and other assistive technologies
